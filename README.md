<h2>Project Title</h2>
Transportation and Traffic Safety Enhancement in Austin, Texas

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This proposal aims to present a comprehensive plan for enhancing transportation and traffic safety in Austin, Texas, with the primary goal of mitigating the financial burden of traffic incidents. The project will focus on analyzing historical traffic data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that will inform targeted improvements.

We've provided five interactive visualizations in our dashboard to show the following data:
